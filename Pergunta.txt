Simulate a tournament output following the next conditions: 
- You need to use this data structure : https://s3.amazonaws.com/cortex-cerebro/playoff_structure.jpg 
- Team count and player count needs to be dynamic ( Use 8 for the team count and 21 for the player count) 
- Each player has a fixed success rating ranging from 0.15 to 1 (at random). 
- Based on a team's players success rating precalculate the average success rating for each team. 
- Based on the team success rating, find the winner by simulating each round. 
- The team having the highest score have higher chances to win. 
(If Team A has a 0.56 rating and Team B has a 0.76 rating, Team B has 0.20 more chances to win the match) 

You will be evaluated on these criteria: 
- Data structure is respected (Classes, Object Oriented Programming) 
- Success rate for a player should be random 
- The logic behind how the match rounds are executed 
- Code general appreciation
